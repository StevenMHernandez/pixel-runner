# Pixel Runner

Pixel Runner uses an Arduino to render scrolling lines at speeds based on user input through two potentiometers.

## Setup

Setup arduino as outlined by the [TVout library](https://code.google.com/p/arduino-tvout/) to allow video output.

Next, connect two potentiometers; one at A0 (this controls X speed), the other at A1 (this controls Y speed).

## Requirements
